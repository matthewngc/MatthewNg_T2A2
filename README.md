## Purpose of this API Webserver. (R1)

---

The purpose of this API Webserver is to allow users to track and record the videogames that they have played, are currently playing or would like to play. Specifically, the problem to be addressed with this API application is the difficulty of managing gaming backlogs and tracking gaming progress for individuals who prefer to play multiple games at once, or like to temporarily leave games unfinished and continue at a later date.

This API application acts as a centralised hub where users can add games and include a tag to mark them as completed, currently in progress, dropped, shelved (temporarily), or plan to play, which allows them to easily track their game collection and history. Additionally, users can also add notes under each game as reviews, story progress, quest reminders and other information specific to these games. Overall, this API webserver provides an effective solution to game progress management.

## Why is it a problem that needs solving? (R2)

---

For most individuals who enjoy playing videogames, a common issue is being able to track the progress of the games they have played, particularly for those who prefer to switch between multiple games, or have commitments that make it difficult to finish a game. This leads to an excessive backlog of unfinished games, and most people may choose to give up on completing an unfinished game as they have forgotten about it, or losing interest due to a game's difficulty or a lack of an active community. This API webserver aims to not only provide a quality-of-life benefit to users, but also create a collaborative environment for gaming communities.
